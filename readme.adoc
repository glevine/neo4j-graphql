= Neo4j-GraphQL Extension
:img: docs/img

NOTE: This branch is for supporting Neo4j 3.2.

image:https://travis-ci.org/neo4j-contrib/neo4j-graphql.svg?branch=3.2["Build Status", link="https://travis-ci.org/neo4j-contrib/neo4j-graphql"]

This implementation provides a GraphQL API to Neo4j, it comes as library but can also be installed as Neo4j server extension to act as a GraphQL endpoint.
It turns GraphQL queries and mutations into Cypher statements and executes them on Neo4j.

We want to explore three approaches:

1. read schema / metadata from the database provide GraphQL DataFetcher that generate and run Cypher (WIP) √
2. make the same work with externally configured schema information (using IDL) √
3. do a direct GraphQL AST to Cypher transformation without bothering with Schema (TBD)


== License

Apache License v2

== Installation

The extension works with Neo4j 3.1 and 3.2 the code on this branch is for *3.2*.

////
=== Using a release

* Download the appropriate release for your version from: https://github.com/neo4j-graphql/neo4j-graphql/releases
* Copy the jar into `$NEO4J_HOME/plugins`
* Edit `$NEO4J_HOME/conf/neo4j.conf` to add: `dbms.unmanaged_extension_classes=org.neo4j.graphql=/graphql`
* Restart your Neo4j server

NOTE: Please consult the https://neo4j.com/docs/operations-manual/current/configuration/file-locations/[Neo4j documentation] for file locations for the different operating system and editions.
////

=== Using with neo4j-graphql-cli

This extension is utilized when you use https://www.npmjs.com/package/neo4j-graphql-cli[`neo4j-graphql-cli`]

The script spawns a Neo4j sandbox with your schema and provides the /graphql/ endpoint, a Neo4j server and an hosted GraphiQL for it.

----
npm install -g neo4j-graphql-cli
neo4j-graphql movies-schema.graphql
----

=== Building manually

----
git clone https://github.com/neo4j-contrib/neo4j-graphql
cd neo4j-graphql
git checkout 3.2
mvn clean package
cp target/neo4j-graphql-*.jar $NEO4J_HOME/plugins
echo 'dbms.unmanaged_extension_classes=org.neo4j.graphql=/graphql' >> $NEO4J_HOME/conf/neo4j.conf
$NEO4J_HOME/bin/neo4j restart
----

=== Pre-built

The jar files in the `dist/` folder are pre-built and ready to copy into `$NEO4J_HOME/plugins`.

----
cp dist/neo4j-graphql-*.jar $NEO4J_HOME/plugins
echo 'dbms.unmanaged_extension_classes=org.neo4j.graphql=/graphql' >> $NEO4J_HOME/conf/neo4j.conf
$NEO4J_HOME/bin/neo4j restart
----

The `Dockerfile` describes an image based on `openjdk:8-jdk` that when built will build neo4j-graphql. Run the following docker commands to pre-build the extension. This should be done anytime changes are made to the extension.

----
docker build -t 'neo4j-graphql-dist' .
docker run --rm -i -v ${PWD}/dist:/var/tmp/dist neo4j-graphql-dist sh -s <<EOF
chown -v $(id -u):$(id -g) target/neo4j-graphql-*.jar
cp -va target/neo4j-graphql-*.jar /var/tmp/dist
EOF
----

=== Using with the neo4j docker image

The https://hub.docker.com/_/neo4j/[`neo4j docker image`] is based on `openjdk:8-jre-alpine`. The JDK, not the JRE, is needed to manually build the package with maven within an extension script. To use in a neo4j docker container, provide an `EXTENSION_SCRIPT` to copy the pre-built jar files before neo4j is started.

----
#!/bin/bash

apk update && apk add git
git clone https://github.com/neo4j-graphql/neo4j-graphql
cd neo4j-graphql
git checkout 3.2
cp dist/neo4j-graphql-*.jar /var/lib/neo4j/plugins
echo 'dbms.unmanaged_extension_classes=org.neo4j.graphql=/graphql' >> /var/lib/neo4j/conf/neo4j.conf
cd ..
----

== GraphQL Schema

=== Uploading a Schema

You can post GraphQL IDL schema to the `/graphql/idl` endpoint or run the `graphql.idl('schema') procedure. The schema is parsed and stored in the graph.
That schema is then used as GraphQL schema for validating and executing queries.

We automatically generate query types for each of the types.

* e.g. `User(name,age,first,offset,_id,sort): [User]`

Also mutations for each type are created, which return the executed graph operations.
e.g.

* `createMovie(title: String!, released: Int, tagline: String)` and
* `addMoviePersons(title: String!, persons:[String]!)`

Those mutations then allow you to create graph data with GraphQL.

=== Schema from Graph

The library samples the existing data and adds one GraphQLObject for each Node-Label with all the properties and their types found as outputs and input-arguments.

Relationship information is collected with direction, type, end-node-labels and degree (to determine single element or collection result).
// Additional labels on a node are added as GraphQLInterface's.
Each relationship-type virtual property to the node type, named `aType` for `A_TYPE`.
// Each relationship-type and end-node label is added as a virtual property to the node type, named `TYPE_Label` for outgoing and `Label_TYPE` for incoming relationships.

== Usage

Run `:play movies` in your Neo4j Server, click the statement and run it to insert the basic movie graph.

== GraphiQL

Get GraphiQL electron app from: https://github.com/skevy/graphiql-app

If your Neo4j Server runs with auth enabled, add the appropriate Basic-Auth header in the "Edit HTTP Headers" screen.

----
echo "Authorization: Basic $(echo -n "neo4j:<password>" | base64)"
----

And then run a query like:

----
query AllPeopleQuery {
  Person(name:"Kevin Bacon") {
    name
    born
    actedIn {
      title
      released
      tagline
    }
  }
}
----

image::{img}/graphiql.jpg[width=600]

You can also use variables or query the schema:

.Which types are in the schema
----
{
  __schema {
    types {
      name
      kind
      description
    }
  }
}
----

or

.Which types are available for querying
----
{
  __schema {
    queryType {
      fields { name, description }
    }
  }
}
----

and then query for real data

----
# query
query PersonQuery($name: String!) {
  Person(name: $name) {
    name
    born
    actedIn {
      title
      released
      tagline
    }
  }
}
# variables
{"name":"Keanu Reeves"}
----

== Procedure

This library also comes with a User Defined Procedure to execute GraphQL:

[source,cypher]
----
WITH '{ Person(born: 1961) { name, born } }' as query, {} as params

CALL graphql.execute(query,params) YIELD result

UNWIND result.Person as p
RETURN p.name, p.born
----

You can also visualize your GraphQL schema in Neo4j Browser via a procedure.

[source,cypher]
----
CALL graphql.schema()
----

image::{img}/graphql.schema.jpg[width=600]

And you can even visualize remote graphql schemas, e.g. here from the https://developer.github.com/v4/[GitHub GraphQL API^].
Make sure to generate the https://developer.github.com/v4/guides/forming-calls/#authenticating-with-graphql[Personal Access Token^] to use in your account settings.

[source,cypher]
----
call graphql.introspect("https://api.github.com/graphql",{Authorization:"bearer d8xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"})

== Features

// tag::features[]

[options=header,cols="a,2a,3m"]
|===

| name | information | example
| entities
| each node label represented as entity
| { Person {name,born} }

| multi entities
| multiple entities per query turned into `UNION`
| { Person {name,born} Movie {title,released} }

| properties (out)
| via sampling property names and types are determined
| { Movie {title, released} }

| field parameters
| all properties can be used as filtering (exact/list) input parameters, will be turned into Cypher parameters
| { Movie(title:"The Matrix") {name,released} }

| query parameters
| passed through as Cypher parameters
| query MovieByParameter ($title: String!) { Person(name:$name) {name,born} }

| relationships
| via a `@relationship` annotated field, optional direction
| type Person { name: String, movies : Movie @relation(name:"ACTED_IN", direction:OUT) }

| ordering
| via an extra `orderBy` parameter
| query PersonSortQuery { Person(orderBy:[name_desc,born_desc]) {name,born}}

| pagination
| via `first` and `offset` parameters
| query PagedPeople { Person(first:10, offset:20) {name,born}}

| schema first IDL support
| define schema via IDL
| :POST /graphql/idl "type Person {name: String!, born: Int}"

| Mutations | create/delete mutations inferred from the schema |
createMovie(title:ID!, released:Int)
updateMovie(title:ID!, released:Int)
deleteMovie(title:ID!)

createMoviePersons(title:ID!,persons:[ID!])
deleteMoviePersons(title:ID!,persons:[ID!])

| Cypher queries
| `@cypher` directive on fields and types, parameter support
| actors : Int @cypher(statement:"RETURN size((this)<-[:ACTED_IN]-())")

| Cypher updates
| Custom mutations by executing `@cypher` directives
| createPerson(name: String) : Person @cypher(statement:"CREATE (p:Person {name:{name}}) RETURN p")

| extensions
| extra information returned
| fields are: columns, query, warnings, plan, type READ_ONLY/READ_WRITE,
// | directive | directives control cypher prefixes, *note that directives have to be set at the first entity* |
// | directive - query plan | `@profile / @explain` will be returned in extra field `extensions` | query UserQuery { User @profile {name} }

// | directive - version | set cypher version to use `@version(3.0,3.1,3.2)` | query UserQuery { User @version(3.0) {name} }
|===


[NOTE]
`@cypher` directives can have a  `passThrough:true` argument, that gives sole responsibility for the nested query result for this field to your Cypher query.
You will have to provide all data/structure required by client queries.
Otherwise, we assume if you return object-types that you will return the appropriate nodes from your statement.

== TODO

* Non-Null and Nullable Input and Output Types
* https://www.reindex.io/docs/graphql-api/connections/#connection-arguments[Pagination]: Skip and Limit (first,last,after,before,skip,limit)
* √ https://www.reindex.io/docs/graphql-api/connections/#orderby[orderBy] with enum _PersonOrdering { name_asc,name_desc,... }
* https://www.reindex.io/docs/graphql-api/connections/#filtering[Filtering] with support of a object argument for an input-argument-field, with key=comparator, and value compare-value +

* Handle result aggregation.
* How to handle Geospatial and other complex input types
* √ Support for Directives, e.g. to specify the cypher compiler or runtime? or special handling for certain fields or types
* √ Add `extensions` result value for query statistics or query plan, depending on directives given, e.g. contain the generated cypher query as well
* @skip, @include directives, check if they are handled by the library
* √ handle nested relationships as optional or non-optional (perhaps via nullable?) or directive
* √ project non-found nested results as null vs. map with null-value entries
* https://facebook.github.io/relay/docs/graphql-connections.html#content[Connection] add support for edges / nodes special properties
* √ Support 3.1 via pattern comprehensions and map projections
* Improvements: consider replacing MetaData with GraphQL types,
* check if there is a direct conversion from parsed data (AST-Nodes) to graphql-schema types

////
== Rewrite

* Replace Metadata with GraphQLTypes / Interfaces -> use GraphQLReferenceType to break cyclic dependencies
* Keep tests
* Store meta-information in directives (@relation, @isUnique etc.)
* Change db-scanner to generate GraphQL-Types
* Use schema parser to turn IDL into types
* Add transformations, that e.g. adds dynamic query and mutation types with @cypher directives and custom enums/input objects
* Add transformation for pagination, filter, ordering on all primitive fields
* Allow for further transformations
* Unify custom and generated dynamic fields (handle mutations and root queries separately with graphql.run procedure, inline with function
* Generate Cypher query from current query + schema information
* Build easy transform functions from schema objects into simpler data clases e.g. a Cypher class with (query, parameters) or Relationship(field,type,direction,start-label,end-label)
* The only "wiring" we have to add is for top level objects

1. Schema source
2. Schema
3. Transform/Augment with custom queries & mutations
4. Generate queries based on schema + query

== Open

* Unions
* Subscriptions

== Permissions

* provide username, adminstatus and roles as parameters to cypher query
* make them queryable from graphql with __User {name, roles, admin, active}
* support the permission queries from graph cool using the user and their roles
